## Description

This project is a full back end API for an e-commerce website built with sequelize. In this API you are able to get all data for categories, products, and tags/ get a specific category, product, or tag by Id/ create a new category, product, or tag/ update a category, product, or tag/ delete a product, category, or tag. The API also include a many to many relationship. Working on this project really helped me get used to using sequelize to create models, create relationships between models, and to use sequelizes different functions to interact with the DB.
